### ðŸ§¼ Clean Script

This project includes a `clean.sh` script to remove all build artifacts, caches, and lock files from both the root and `example/` directories (Android and iOS).

#### Usage

Make the script executable (only once):

```bash
chmod +x clean.sh
```

Then run the script anytime you want to clean the project:

```bash
./clean.sh
```
